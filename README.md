# Databases and Data Banks Course Project (WIP)


A distributed system with server providing an access to a retail database via REST API, forecasting node
containing basic viewing and editing functionality and providing REST API for forecast requests and client for generating procurement plans.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle _(find and place an original link here later)_ and normalized using Tableau Prep.

REST API was written using FastAPI framework.

GUI is written using PyImGUI with the GLFW integration.
